        <span class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[6] often abbreviated as JS,
        is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[7] <span stype="font-weight:bold;">JavaScript</span> is high-level,
        often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
        object-orientation, and first-class functions. Alongside HTML and CSS, <span stype="font-weight:bold;">JavaScript</span> is one of the core
        technologies of the World Wide Web.[8] <span stype="font-weight:bold;">JavaScript</span> enables interactive web pages and is an essential part
        of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[9] and all major
        web browsers have a dedicated <span stype="font-weight:bold;">JavaScript</span> engine to execute it. As a multi-paradigm language, <span stype="font-weight:bold;">JavaScript</span>
        supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming
        interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures,
        and the Document Object Model (DOM).
